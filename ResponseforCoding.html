    <p  font: "Domine", serif;>This article was about the analyzation of what a website is, or what it could be. Based on the information given in the essay, a website can be anything; as long as it is able to be an individual node that can connect to other individual sited within the entire realm of the internet. It is what the creator makes it, and can be compared to a lot of different things and concepts because there isn’t a solid definition as to what a website actually is. This article also touched briefly on the subject of the first article; referring to the same concept of “handmade” web being important, as individuals should define the future of the internet, instead of large companies and hosting sites. </p>

<h1 class="headers"><a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/love">Response to “Love” by Group Z, Belgium (MichalL Samyn)(1995)</a><h1>

<p  font: "Domine", serif;>This article was about the website "Love" by group Z. It talks about the different features of the website, and how the website goes through the designer's own personal experiences with love, as well as different societal notions of love. The article included a link to the interactive piece, which was contained within an old browser window that you could interact with. This feature was really neat; you could choose not to interact with the piece and end up going through different websites and files on the browser. I'm not sure if this was intended, but it makes the piece extremely interesting due to the endless possibilities. The story is extremely abstract and contains a lot of interesting elements; such as the different outcomes you can find by clicking different elements presented on the pages. I also really liked the interactive portion that included picking the petals off of a daisy; it was an interesting animation and concept to include in the space and went along really well with the concept. </p>
