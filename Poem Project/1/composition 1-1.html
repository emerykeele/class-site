<p>EBBA LINDQVIST</p>
<p>TRANSLATED BY JANICE D. SODERLING</p>
<p>Give us today
our daily bread.</p>

<p>You ask what we mean?</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Well, by daily bread</p>
<br>

<br>we mean ordinary bread

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>ordinary old-fashioned bread</em></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>that doesn’t contain too much strontium 90
and give us not too high a dose
of radioiodine 131 in our breast milk
so our infants won’t be damaged
already before their first birthday.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Can you please make that your will?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>We ask in this prayer
that you allow those heavy clouds
charged with nuclear radiation
to drift up to the Arctic regions
without damaging any living thing,
<br>not the grass, not the herbs,—
<br>and relieve us of our charge
over the fowl of the air
and the fish of the sea.</p>

<p>Deliver us from our dominion over the earth.
We seem to have totally
lost control.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> And that’s a fact.</p>
